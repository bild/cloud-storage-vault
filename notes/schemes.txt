# Document possible schemes to use

Sym = Symmetric Key
Pub = Public Key
Pri = Private Key


Encryption of files
    - Alice:
        - E_f = Sym_1(File)
        - E_SA = Pub_A(Sym)
        - Uploads E_f and E_SA

    - Alice wants to share file with BOB
        - Alice downloads E_SA
        - Sym = Pri_A(File)
        - E_SB = Pub_B(Sym)
        - Uploads E_SB

    - Alice wants to revoce BOBs access
        - Alice deletes E_SB
            - Bob can stil know Sym
                + But cannot access file (blocket by application)
                +/- Leakage, but at the same time, bob already knows the contents
                  of the file
                - Problem is different if we assume files can actually change
                  on server
                    - E.g. Change does not happen by downloading, changing,
                      then uploading (encrypting with new SYM) and then giving
                      new keys to everyone


Read/Write access
    - Is there another solution but explicitly stating read or write
      permission?
        - Dependant of encryption scheme
            - E.g. Read/Write capabilities in Tahoe-LAFS


Authentication
    + PKI/Certificates/PGP combined with Encryption scheme stated above
